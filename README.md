# SoundReplacement 

a mod for rhythm doctor that allows to replace in-game sounds by naming it the internal name

place sounds (.ogg or .wav) to replace in a `replaced/` folder (can have sub folders) that is in the same location as the executable file

if you have multiple files of the same name (e.g. spread across seperate sub folders) it'll pick randomly each time that sound is """got"""

if a subfolder starts with "!!" it'll skip that sub folder

my first time using bepinex so might not be the best

to compile make sure to read [lib/note.txt](lib/note.txt)!
